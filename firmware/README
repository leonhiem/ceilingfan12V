The fan can run on 4 speeds. The button on PB3 toggles round 5 states:

0=off    
1=slow   (~26Hz, 3.3 Watt)
2=medium (~31Hz    5 Watt)
3=fast   (~37Hz  6.6 Watt)
4=faster (~41Hz    7 Watt)


fan running on 12V using push-pull MOSFET driver


7 Watt ceilingfan bought in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for US$7.
Runs on 230 VAC. Has 4180 turns of 1x 0.2mm copperwire strand (740 Ohm)


Rewinded the coil:
------------------
number of turns 0.4mm (diameter) copperwire: 210 
However it turns out that the necessary VDC must be 16.5V
on the DC supply side of the push-pull mosfet PCB.

For winding the coil: Take 2 strands of 0.4mm copperwire.
Length is 27meter. Wind bifilar on bobbin 210 turns.

Update:
-------
Because now the fan only works from 16.5V I tried to change that to work from 12V.
I tried to decrease the number of turns to 100 in steps of 40.
100 turns is too low (MOSFETs get hot).
At 160 turns I see the fan works fine at 13.7V.

If the voltage is too low, the fan is not strong enough to achieve full speed.

Idea: 
- The copper wire thickness might need to be increased
- To reduce the skineffect 2 stands of wire instead of 1 might help.
